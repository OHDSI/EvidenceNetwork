In the United States, these processes will follow your organization’s local interpretation for maintaining compliance to PII and PHI protection. In OMOP CDM implementations containing European Union citizen data, local governance processes will include measures to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1]. As a community, the OHDSI data network covers more than 500 databases from 49 countries. There is extensive community knowledge on the interpretation of rule sets and exemplar IRB and local governance workflows that can be made available to institutions navigating these processes for the first time. If your organization does not have an established data governance process, please reach out on the OHDSI Forums under “Implementers” and the community can respond with shared guidance from their own deployments. As a community, we aim to conduct research that keeps patient-level data local and share only aggregate results.\nPrivacy preserving processes are not one-size fits all.

All our solutions are open-source.\nOHDSI’s mission - To improve health by empowering a community to collaboratively generate the evidence that promotes better health decisions and better care.\nEvidence Network mission - To connect those who need data with those who have data in order to generate evidence at scale in accordance with OHDSI’s mission.\nThe Evidence Network meets twice a month on Thursdays at 10:30am EST. Please join us on the MS Teams call\n\n\nCollaborators say…\n\n\n\n\n\n“Joining the OHDSI Evidence Network was important to me because it allows us to increase the diversity of patient populations represented in the network, particularly from the Midwest U.S., which is currently underrepresented. I believe that the methods developed by OHDSI can enhance care and improve patient health within my local healthcare system. The process to join was straightforward, thanks to OHDSI’s collaborative and open-source community, with ample support through documentation, forums, and workgroup calls. By being part of the network, I hope to engage more data partners so we can tackle challenging clinical problems together, such as rare diseases and rare adverse drug reactions, which are often impossible to address with a single database.”\nLinying Zhang, Washington University at St. Louis\n\n\n\n\n“This block would include a quote from a government source.”\nGovernment Quote Source\n\n\n\n\n“This block would include a quote from an industry source.”\nIndustry Quote Source"
