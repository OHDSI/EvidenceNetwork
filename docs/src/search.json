All our solutions are open-source.\nOHDSI’s mission - To improve health by empowering a community to collaboratively generate the evidence that promotes better health decisions and better care.\nEvidence Network mission - To connect those who need data with those who have data in order to generate evidence at scale in accordance with OHDSI’s mission.\nThe Evidence Network meets the second Thursday of the month at 10:30am EST. Please join us on the MS Teams call\n\n\nCollaborators say…\n\n\n\n\n\n“The OHDSI community is a well-organized and highly welcoming community of experts who have helped me grow throughout my career. I was honored to bring European data into the OHDSI Evidence Network because of the importance of a diverse patient population for our global studies. As expected, the support and guidance I received from the community made the process both simple and fulfilling. Heliant Health, along with its data partners in the Balkans region, looks forward to joining this critical initiative and generate the necessary evidence to improve healthcare.”\nFilip Maljković, Core Tech Lead, Heliant Health\n\n\n\n\n“Joining the OHDSI Evidence Network was important to me because it allows us to increase the diversity of patient populations represented in the network, particularly from the Midwest U.S., which is currently underrepresented. I believe that the methods developed by OHDSI can enhance care and improve patient health within my local healthcare system. The process to join was straightforward, thanks to OHDSI’s collaborative and open-source community, with ample support through documentation, forums, and workgroup calls. By being part of the network, I hope to engage more data partners so we can tackle challenging clinical problems together, such as rare diseases and rare adverse drug reactions, which are often impossible to address with a single database.”\nLinying Zhang, Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the Institute for Informatics, Data Science, & Biostatistics, Washington University at St. Louis\n\n\n\n\n“HealthPartners Institute was motivated to join the OHDSI Evidence Network to collaborate with organizations around the world and contribute to research that can promote better health and improve care – both locally and on a global scale. Prior to joining, we secured leadership buy-in, IRB approval, and limited funding to support our participation. We felt very supported throughout the process of joining the Evidence Network, and the OHDSI staff were helpful and responsive to questions we had along the way. We look forward to building relationships with other members and participating in workgroups to make meaningful contributions to research in the future.”\nSam Patnoe, Senior Programmer Analyst, Research Informatics, Health Partners Institute"

    "text": "Becoming a Data Partner Organization (DPO) in the OHDSI Evidence Network places your organization at the forefront of observational research. As a DPO, you’ll contribute to an open, collaborative network that connects researchers and organizations, advancing health research outcomes worldwide. The data source contributions of DPOs streamline the OHDSI Evidence Network initiative which strives for alignment between available data and research questions. Not only does joining the evidence network place your data in a network that fosters such research advancement, but also this data partner contribution receives recognition via display on the OHDSI website. The following article gives a high-level overview describing the requirements to join, what you will need to share with the OHDSI Coordinating Center, and what you can expect when you join the OHDSI Evidence Network as a Data Partner Organization.\nNote: The OHDSI Evidence Network Member agrees not to share any patient information that constitutes protected health information or share confidential business information. It is the intent of the OHDSI Coordinating Center to keep all shared information private, but in the event of an external breach, the OHDSI Coordinating Center is not liable for loss of the information. If an OHDSI Evidence Network Member accidentally shares confidential information, the OHDSI Coordinating Center will delete that information to the extent possible at the time of the discovery of the breach.",

This account identifies them as members of the network and will be used for communication within the OHDSI Teams environment to coordinate OHDSI efforts. The email address will not be shared publicly.\nData Source Feedback Report: Additionally, the organization will receive a report for each data source submitted to the network. This report will compare each data source to others in the network using network-based benchmarks. The report will include metrics such as concepts unique to the data source, concepts present in other data sources but missing from the submitted data source, and comparisons of demographic representation.\nMicrosoft Teams Access: Organizations will be added to the OHDSI Microsoft Teams environment to include access to a resource library.",

Much like the ancient Greeks who connected stars into constellations to tell stories, OHDSI connects data partners around the world, transforming disparate datasets into meaningful, actionable evidence that improves patient care. Whether you represent government, academia, or industry, the OHDSI Evidence Network offers unparalleled opportunities to advance science, foster innovation, and achieve real-world impact.\n\n\nThe OHDSI Evidence Network is a global community dedicated to connecting researchers with data sources, fostering collaborations that lead to evidence generation. The network’s mission is simple yet profound: to leverage real-world data to improve patient outcomes. Through the adoption of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and open-source tools like Atlas, OHDSI simplifies the process of data integration and analysis, reducing barriers to high-quality research.\n\n\n\nOrganizations across government, academia, and industry each have unique motivations for joining the OHDSI Evidence Network. Here are some key benefits for each group:\n\n\nData Accessibility and Insights: Agencies like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have found immense value in transforming their complex datasets into the OMOP CDM. This shift not only reduced the learning curve for researchers but also improved the reliability of evidence generated from their data.\nCollaboration and Innovation: By participating in OHDSI, government organizations gain access to cutting-edge methodologies, such as large-scale propensity score modeling and negative controls, enabling them to deliver robust, impactful evidence for public health initiatives.\nMission Alignment: For entities like the VA, OHDSI’s focus on improving patient outcomes directly aligns with their mission of serving veterans and their families.\n\n\n\nEnhanced Research Capabilities: Participation in OHDSI network studies allows academic researchers to better understand the strengths and limitations of their data. Institutions like IDIAP Jordi Gol in Spain have used OHDSI to improve data quality and generate impactful evidence, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTraining and Career Development: The use of standardized tools and collaborative studies provides a rich training ground for students and researchers, fostering skill development and career advancement.\nVisibility and Recognition: Academic data partners often earn trust and credibility as reliable contributors, opening doors to prestigious opportunities like DARWIN EU, a federated network supporting regulatory decision-making in Europe.\n\n\n\nReal-World Evidence Generation: Companies like IQVIA recognize the growing importance of real-world evidence in shaping regulatory and commercial strategies.
